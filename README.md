The goal of omicsTools is to provide tools for processing and analyzing
omics data from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics
platforms. It provides functions for preprocessing, normalization,
visualization, and statistical analysis, as well as machine learning
algorithms for predictive modeling. omicsTools is an essential tool for
researchers working with high-throughput omics data in fields such as
biology, bioinformatics, and medicine.
